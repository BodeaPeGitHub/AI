This repository contains some basic problems of Artificial Intelligence.

* `Problem 1` directory contains the solution to some simple problems simple problems 
described [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab01/AI-lab01.md).

* `Problem 2` directory contains the solution to the problem of searching for communities 
in a graph with the Greedy method (more details about the 
problem are [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab02/AI-lab02.md))

* `Problem 3` directory contains the solution to the searching for communities in a graph problem but it's solved with a genetic algorithm 
([GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)). 
More about the problem [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab03/AI-lab03.md)

* `Problem 4` direcotry contains the solution to the TSP problem in a graph solved with an evolutionary algorithm. 
[The problem detailes](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab04/AI-lab04.md).

* `Problem 5` directory contains the solution to the TSP problem in a graph solves with an ACO (ant colony optimisation) algoritm.
[The problem detailes](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab05/AI-lab05.md).

* `Problem 6` directory contains the solution for a regression problem where I used the least squares method for predicting what makes people happy.
More detailes [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab06/AI-lab06.md).

* `Problem 7` directory contains the solution for evaluating the Problem 6 results.
More detailes [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab07/AI-lab07.md).

* `Problem 8` directory contains the solution for a logistic regression problem where I had to predict the type of Iris
flower based on petal and sepal sizes.
More detailes [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab08/AI-lab08.md).

* `Problem 9` directory contains the same problem solution as the last one but with diferent loss functions.
More detailes [here](https://github.com/lauradiosan/AI-UBB/blob/main/2021-2022/labs/lab09/AI-lab09.md).

* `Problem 10` directory contains the solution for the flower problem, what digit is in the photo solved with an Neural Network algirithm.
